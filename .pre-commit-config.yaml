        # Ignores the following rules:
        # E006: Line longer than 79 columns (as many scripts use jinja
        #       templating, this is very difficult)
        # E040: Syntax error determined using `bash -n` (as many scripts
        #       use jinja templating, this will often fail and the syntax
        #       error will be discovered in execution anyway)
        # TODO(ssbarnea): remove temporary skips made during adoption:
        # E002 Tab indents
        # E010 The "do" should be on same line as for
        # E011 Then keyword is not on same line as if or elif keyword
        # E020 Function declaration not in format ^function name {$
        # E041 Arithmetic expansion using $[ is deprecated for $((
        # E042 local declaration hides errors
